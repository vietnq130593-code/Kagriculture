"""Climb-safe sparse shop router.

The policy deliberately has only two route-changing observations:

* first unlocked shop is YARN_STORE -> use the validated yarn-first suffix;
* second unlocked shop is YARN_STORE -> use the validated yarn-second suffix.

All route policies are advanced on every turn.  This keeps their bounded weed
repair transactions synchronized before a suffix is selected.  BAKERY does
not select a farm route: it only enables an independent, reserve-safe EGG
market-making expert, and only after the shop is publicly visible.
